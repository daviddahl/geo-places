Client side mapping of GPS coordinates to place names

This project uses the GeoNames Creative Commons licensed data set to generate a JS object that knows all city place names where 1000 or more people live. Its not perfect but might work for the 80% case.

The idea is to allow mobile devices to be able to derive a place name from GPS coordinates without using any kind of service such as Google - to be abel to provide these place names *privately* 

The cities1000.txt has already been pre-processed to escape all ' and "
